            <p>
              Simply put, financial assessment is the process of identifying and defining your financial goals, prioritizing them and achieving these goals with a clear, focused and a customized game plan. Financial Assessment can help you achieve both greater wealth and financial security, while inadequate or improper planning can be disastrous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Financial Assessment is an ongoing and continuous activity involving investment management, cash flow planning, retirement solutions, insurance solutions and tax solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Financial assessment is a long-term process of wisely managing your finances so that you can achieve your goals and dreams. It is a process, which starts with the identification of your specific goals. Once this critical phase is complete, pertinent data is gathered and your goals are analyzed in terms of your ability to achieve them.
            </p>
            <p>These goals may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Buying a house</li>
              <li>Buying a car</li>
              <li>Saving for your child's education</li>
              <li>Your daughter's marriage</li>
              <li>Eventually planning for retirement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Financial assessment is all about preplanning. Most young professionals today do not plan their finances - some because of a lack of awareness about its benefits, others because of their belief that they do not require it at the initial stage of their careers and some others because it may be expensive for them now.
            </p>

              The sooner you start investing, the more time your money will have to grow - pure and simple "compounding" or the "snowball effect" on your money.

            <p>
              Mutual Funds are financial instruments. These funds are collective investments which gather money from different investors to invest in stocks, short-term money market financial instruments, bonds and other securities and distribute the proceeds as dividends. The Mutual Funds in India are handled by Fund Managers, also referred to as the portfolio managers. The Securities Exchange Board of India regulates the Mutual Funds in India. The unit value of the Mutual Funds in India is known as net asset value per share (NAV). The NAV is calculated on the total amount of the Mutual Funds in India, by dividing it with the number of units issued and outstanding units on a daily basis.

            <p>
              It is more famously known as SIP. It is bit by bit systematic investment. Under this plan, your investments are staggered. You invest a fixed sum either monthly or quarterly in a mutual fund.
            </p>
            <p>
              SIP helps in averaging the cost as equal amounts are invested regularly every month at different NAVs. SIP works well in a volatile market as in the months where markets are down you get more units, and when the markets are up you get fewer units.
